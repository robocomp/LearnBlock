Apart from the requirements of LearnBlock you will need to install the library Gradio.

Also, it uses some code from [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection), but as is very few code was preferable to include only that code intead of installing the complete API.

It can be installed easily with **pip** with the following command:

      pip install gradio
