# Thymio

Using Thymio with LearnBlock requires for the installation of gobject and aseba. For Python3 gobject can be installed as follows:

    sudo pip3 install PyGObject

To install aseba, you can run the following command:

    sudo apt-get install aseba

Be sure that the dongle of the robot is properly attached to a USB port of your computer. Then run the following command on a terminal:

    sudo asebamedulla "ser:name=Thymio-II" 

After that you can run programs created with LearnBlock on the Thymio robot (ver la sección [Ejecutar un programa desde LearnBlock](<hidepath>/ES/4. Ejecutar un programa desde LearnBlock/README.html)).
