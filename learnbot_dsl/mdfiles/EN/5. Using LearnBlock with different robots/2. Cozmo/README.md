# Cozmo

In order to use the Cozmo robot with the LearnBlock programming tool, the Cozmo mobile App must be installed on a mobile device and that device has to be tethered to your computer via USB cable. You will also need to enable the debug mode on your mobile device.

Besides, your will need to install the Cozmo SDK on your computer. The installation steps for the different operating systems can be found in [http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/). If you have an Android mobile device, the installation of Android Device Bridge (adb) is also required ([http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html#adb](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/adb.html#adb)).

Once all the above requirements are satisfied, run the Cozmo App and connect to the robot. Then, click on the gear icon and select “Enter SDK mode”. Now, everything is ready to run programs from LearnBlock on the Cozmo robot (see the section [Program execution](<hidepath>/EN/4. Program execution/README.html)).
