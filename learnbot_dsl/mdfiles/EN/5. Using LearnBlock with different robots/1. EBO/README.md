# EBO

To use EBO, you will need to install [RoboComp](https://github.com/robocomp/robocomp).

After installing RoboComp, switch the robot on and connect your computer to the wifi network of the robot (SSID: Learnbot02 ; Password: Learnbot02). Once the connection is established, EBO is available to run a program created using LearnBlock (see the section [Program execution](<hidepath>/EN/4. Program execution/README.html)).
