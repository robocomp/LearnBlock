# Learnbot
LearnBot is a social low cost robot that has been designed in to  the  area  of  educational  robotics  for  promoting  the  development of  computational  thinking  in  diferent  educational  stages,  specically through the learning of the Python language. It has being entirely built using a robotics framework developed by our Robotic Laboratory. But Learnbot is part of a more ambitious ecosystem, Code2Bot, which is being  created  as  a  facilitator  environment  to  encourage  current  teacher swith out programming knowledge to learn the basics of Python, at least into a level where they can introduce their students into the digital world. Also Code2Bot is developed as a collaborative environment to facilitate the introduction of robotics programming in non technological areas of the curriculum. This paper describes the design and construction process of Learnbot, the conception of the web ecosystem, a concise theoretical and  conceptual framework  and  an  analysis  of  the  results  of  an  initial validation experiment.
